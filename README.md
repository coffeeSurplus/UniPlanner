# UniPlanner

> a small project i've been working on for a couple of months. i'm a 17-year-old a-level (uk) student and have been learning computer science and c# for ~1.5 years. no clue what i'm doing hahaha.

> anyway, this is my second 'full' project i've been working on. it's a simple wpf desktop app which i've named 'UniPlanner', allowing users to plan their study/revision.
